	</p>
        <p><strong>Q1.</strong> Why did you start working out?</p> 
        <p><strong><i>A. I started working out because of the stock market crash of 2009 and I had to provide for my family.</i></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Q2.</strong> Do you skip leg day?</p>
        <p><strong><i>A. I never skip leg day. Skipping leg day is a sin and whoever does shall repent.</i></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Q3.</strong> Do you have voices in your head when you work out?</p>
        <p><strong><i>A. Yes these voices began when I started benching over 300. The voices don't stop and they tell me to do absurd things.</i></strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Q4.</strong> Why are you so loud in the gym? I am seldom able to hear my music when I am working out in your presence.</p>
        <p><strong><i>A. One doesn't just GO to the gym. You have to LIVE in the gym- breathe it, revel in it, and scream through the increasingly spectacular weight you put up. !!!STAY HARD!!!</i></strong>
